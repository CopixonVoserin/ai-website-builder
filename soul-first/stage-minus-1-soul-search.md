# Stage -1: Soul Search - Find Your Real Problem üîç

## Stop Coding. Start Feeling.

Before you write a single line of code, you need to find a problem that actually matters.

## The Soul Search Process

### 1. The Anger Journal (This Week)

Write down every time you got pissed off about software:

```
Monday:
- Spent 30 min formatting a report AGAIN
- Had to manually copy data between tools
- Couldn't find that important email

Tuesday:
- Rewrote the same email template for 50th time
- Excel crashed and lost formulas
- Had to explain same thing to 3 people

Wednesday:
- Manually updated 20 Jira tickets
- Copy-pasted between 5 documents
- Forgot to follow up with client
```

### 2. The Pain Scale

Rate each problem 1-10:
- **Frequency**: How often does this hurt?
- **Intensity**: How much does it hurt?
- **Duration**: How long does the pain last?
- **Cost**: What does this problem cost you?

```
Problem: "Rewriting email templates"
- Frequency: 8 (daily)
- Intensity: 6 (annoying)
- Duration: 7 (15 min each time)
- Cost: 9 (lost deals from slow response)
Total Pain Score: 30/40
```

### 3. The Would-I-Pay Test

For each problem, ask:
- Would I pay $10/month to solve this?
- Would I pay $50/month?
- Would I pay $100/month?

If you wouldn't pay for it, nobody else will.

### 4. The One-Sentence Test

Can you explain the problem in one sentence that makes people say "OH GOD YES"?

Bad:
- "AI-powered productivity platform"
- "Machine learning for business"
- "Intelligent automation system"

Good:
- "Never write the same email twice"
- "Jira tickets that update themselves"
- "Excel formulas that don't break"

### 5. The Complain Test

What do you complain about to:
- Your spouse/partner?
- Your coworkers?
- Your friends?
- Twitter/Reddit?

Real problems create real complaints.

## Examples of Good Soul Searches

### Example 1: Sales Email Helper

Would Pay: $100/month
One Person: My sales buddy Jake
Simplest Version: LLM with my 10 best templates
```

### Example 2: Code Review Assistant
```
Problem: "I miss the same React bugs in every PR"
Pain Score: 32/40
Would Pay: $50/month
One Person: Sarah on my team
Simplest Version: LLM that flags common React mistakes
```

### Example 3: Meeting Notes Organizer
```
Problem: "I forget what we decided in meetings"
Pain Score: 28/40
Would Pay: $30/month
One Person: My manager
Simplest Version: LLM that extracts action items
```

## Red Flags (Stop If You See These)

### üö© "Everyone could use this"
Nobody needs anything for "everyone". Be specific.

### üö© "It's like Uber but for..."
You're not building Uber. Solve one problem.

### üö© "Once I add 10 features..."
If it needs 10 features, the core problem isn't clear.

### üö© "The market is huge"
Big markets have big competition. Start tiny.

### üö© "I think people might want..."
If you're guessing, you're gambling.

## Green Flags (Proceed If You See These)

### ‚úÖ "I waste 2 hours on this every week"
Time = money = willingness to pay

### ‚úÖ "I tried 5 tools and they all suck"
Existing demand with bad solutions

### ‚úÖ "I complained about this yesterday"
Fresh pain = real pain

### ‚úÖ "I already jury-rigged a solution"
You're already your first customer

### ‚úÖ "My coworker has the same problem"
You already know your second user

## The Soul Search Commitment

**I will not write code until:**
1. I can describe the problem in one sentence
2. I have personally felt this pain this week
3. I would personally pay to solve it
4. I know one other real person with this problem

Sign here: _______________________

Date: ___________________________

## What's Next?

Once you've found your soul problem:
1. Feel the pain for one more week
2. Document every instance
3. Talk to that one other person
4. Confirm they have the same pain
5. THEN move to Stage 0

Remember: **No code until you find real pain.**
