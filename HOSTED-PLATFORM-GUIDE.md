## What This Is

A complete web platform where non-technical users can:

3. Start building immediately
4. Everything saves like a video game

### For You (Platform Owner):
- You host the platform
- Your API keys power everyone's AI
- Users get 100 free requests/month
- You control costs and usage

**Railway (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

**Vercel**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

**Render**
- Push to GitHub
- Connect at render.com

## Configuration

### Essential Settings (.env)
```bash
# Your API keys (not user's)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=random-secret-key

# Free tier limits
FREE_AI_CREDITS=100
MAX_PROJECTS_FREE=10
```

### Database

**Development**: SQLite (automatic, no setup)
**Production**: PostgreSQL
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname
```

## Cost Management

### Your Costs:
- **Hosting**: $0-20/month
- **AI Usage**: ~$0.01 per user request
- **Storage**: Minimal

### User Limits:
- 100 AI requests/month free
- 10 projects max
- Upgrade prompts for more

### Example Math:
- 100 users √ó 100 requests = 10,000 requests/month
- Cost: ~$100/month in AI usage
- Revenue: Offer premium at $10/month

3. **Rate limit API endpoints** (prevent abuse)
4. **Monitor usage** (watch your AI costs)

## The Magic

Non-technical users experience:
- "Just like Google Docs but for building apps"
- No installation headaches
- No API key confusion
- Their work persists between sessions
- Share links to their creations

You provide:
- The hosting (your server)
- The AI (your API keys)
- The platform (this code)

They get to build without barriers!
