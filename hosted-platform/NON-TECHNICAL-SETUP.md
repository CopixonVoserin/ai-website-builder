# üéØ The Super Simple Setup Guide

## You literally just need to do 3 things:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure Node.js is installed
Open Terminal and type:
```
node --version
```

If you see a number (like v18.17.0), you're good! ‚úÖ

If not, go to https://nodejs.org and install it (just click Next, Next, Finish)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Terminal in the right folder
```
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator/llm-course/llm-course-simple/hosted-platform
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the magic command
```
./just-run-this.sh
```

That's it! Your browser will open to http://localhost:3000 üéâ

## What happens next:

1. **Sign Up** - Use any email, even fake@test.com
2. **Create a Project** - Click "Create New Project"
3. **Start Building** - Type what you want, AI builds it

## If something goes wrong:

### "Permission denied"
Run this:
```
chmod +x just-run-this.sh
```

### "Cannot find module"
Run this:
```
npm install
```

### Still broken?
Just run these 3 commands:
```
npm install
node server.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Want to share with friends?

### Quick test (2 hours free):
```
./deploy-simple.sh local
```
This gives you a public URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

### Permanent hosting ($5/month):
1. Get a DigitalOcean account
2. Create a droplet
3. Run: `./deploy-simple.sh vps`

## The TLDR:

You built a platform where people can build apps by chatting. No coding required. You're basically running your own ChatGPT for app building. Your API keys power everyone who signs up. Pretty cool, right? üöÄ
