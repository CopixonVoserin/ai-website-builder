# âœ… Fixed the "Cannot GET /dashboard" Error

The problem was that the server was missing the actual routes for `/dashboard` and `/workspace`. I've fixed it!

## What was broken:
- Server redirected to `/dashboard` after signup
- But there was no route defined for `/dashboard`
- Same issue would happen with `/workspace`

## What I fixed:
1. Added `/dashboard` route that serves dashboard.html
2. Added `/workspace` route for the app builder
3. Added proper authentication checks
4. Fixed the fs imports

## Try it again:

1. Kill any running servers:
```bash
./kill-all-servers.sh
```

2. Start fresh:
```bash
./just-work-dammit.sh
```

3. Sign up again - it should work this time!

The dashboard will load properly after signup, and clicking on projects will take you to the workspace.

## If you STILL get errors:

The nuclear option - completely fresh start:
```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator/llm-course/llm-course-simple/hosted-platform
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json platform.db
npm install
./just-work-dammit.sh
```

But it should work now! ðŸš€
